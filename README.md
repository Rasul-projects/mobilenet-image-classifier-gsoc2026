Deep learning image classifier using MobileNetV2. Upload image and get AI predictions with confidence score. GSoC 2026 preparation project.

# MobileNet Image Classifier (GSoC 2026 Ready)

## Project Overview

This project implements an AI-based image classification system using the MobileNet deep learning model.

The system predicts objects from uploaded images and shows confidence scores using a pre-trained neural network.

## Features:-

- Image classification using MobileNet
- Predicts top objects from images
- Shows confidence percentage
- Runs in Google Colab environment
- Beginner friendly AI project

## Technologies Used on this project
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- MobileNet Model
- Google Colab

## How to Run this code:-

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload an image
3. Run all cells
4. See prediction results

## Future Improvements on this code:-

- Web interface for upload
- Custom dataset training
- Better UI
